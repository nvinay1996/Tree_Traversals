# Tree_Traversals
Project on comparing time complexity of searching a linked list vs binary tree vs balanced binary tree. Building a balanced binary tree from a linked list. I have written, Pre Order, In Order, Post Order Depth First Tree Traversal. Breadth First Tree traversal algorithm also included.
